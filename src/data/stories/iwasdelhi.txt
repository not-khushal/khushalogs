Writing this feels like pouring Delhi out of my heart.

It is strange how a place can feel like a person. When I look back, I don’t just see monuments or maps; I feel a pulse. To say "I was in Delhi" feels inadequate. For a brief, chaotic, beautiful moment in time, I was Delhi.

It starts with the India Gate. Standing there, surrounded by the ice-cream vendors and the late-night walkers, you feel small in the best way possible. It stands like a silent guardian, watching over a city that never really sleeps, only naps with one eye open. Then there is the stillness of Humayun’s Tomb and the towering grandeur of the Qutub Minar. In a city that rushes forward at breakneck speed, these stones force you to stop. They remind you that centuries have walked these streets before you, and centuries will walk them after you are gone.

But the real Delhi? The real Delhi isn’t in the guidebooks. It is in the white-pillared corridors of CP (Connaught Place). I can still hear the echo of my friends' laughter bouncing off those walls as we walked in circles—literally and metaphorically—hunting for the perfect cafe or just wasting time because we had plenty of it.

It is in the galis. Those narrow, suffocating, electrifying lanes where the sun fights to touch the ground. The crowd there doesn’t just walk; it flows like a river. You don’t move; you are carried. And the food—God, the food. It’s an assault on the senses in the most glorious way. The spice that burns your tongue and the sweetness that soothes it immediately after.

And finally, the people. Delhiites have a reputation for being loud, perhaps a little brash. But strip away the noise, and you find a warmth that catches you off guard. It’s a city of millions of strangers who are all somehow living the same story.

Leaving was hard, but in a way, I never really left. The dust of the streets, the noise of the traffic, the taste of the air—it all stayed. I didn't just leave a city; I carried a piece of its soul with me.
