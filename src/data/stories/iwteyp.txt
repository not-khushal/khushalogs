Writing this feels less like typing and more like pulling a cherry blossom petal from a closed book, watching it crumble into dust.

It is strange how a person can become a season. When I look back at this story, I don’t just see a hospital room or a library; I feel the humidity of a summer that happened too fast. To say "I read a story" feels like a lie. For a brief, chaotic, heartbreaking moment in time, I lived alongside a girl who was dying faster than she was living, and a boy who was dead long before his heart stopped beating.

It starts with the secret. Finding that journal—Living with Dying—feels like an invasion, yet it becomes an invitation. Sakura Yamauchi stands there, bright and loud, a firework exploding in a quiet room. She is the opposite of the silence we usually keep around death. She doesn't ask for pity; she demands normalcy. She forces you to realize that we are all waiting in line for the end; she just happens to know her place in the queue.

But the real tragedy? The real tragedy isn’t the inevitable death. It is in the quiet moments between the "Classmate" and the girl. It is in the train rides and the hotel rooms where they played truth or dare, not to learn secrets, but to learn souls. They were galaxies apart—one seeking solitude, the other seeking connection—colliding to form a universe that could only exist for a few months.

And finally, the title. "I want to eat your pancreas." It sounds gruesome to the uninitiated. But strip away the shock, and you find a prayer. It is the desperate, clawing need to take the best parts of someone—their bravery, their light, their joy—and plant them inside your own ribcage so they never truly leave.

She taught him that he wasn't boring; he was just saving his energy for her. And he taught her that she wasn't just a disease; she was the world. We don't just lose people. If we love them right, we become them.
